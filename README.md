Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! The majority of my game implementation is fairly simple. The hardest part (obviously) of the game is the logic that goes into determining the winner. I went about it by using a 2d array in which all possible user combinations are stored together and if that index contains the user choices, then it is selected and the [i,2]th position of the array contains the number that is put into a list and then output to the user and tells exactly what happened i.e. scissor decapitates lizard.
