Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock! The majority of my game implementation is fairly simple. The hardest part (obviously) of the game is the logic that goes into determining the winner. I went about it by using a 2d array in which all possible user combinations are stored together and if that index contains the user choices, then it is selected and the winner is selected and displayed from a list of the possible options.
